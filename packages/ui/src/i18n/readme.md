woot's scheme is identical to dictionary encoding in a column store. how can we collaborate on this though?
maybe we can version the set of strings. maybe we use use a string prefix to influence locality. (although this is a suffix per uniqueness? we don't necessarily want the string multiple times)

dictionary encoding is an odd fit here! all the strings are unique. prefix encoding is potentially helpful if we can sort the keys usefully. note that keys like "x $0 y" are useful because the key is the default translation.



would an lsm approach make sense? maybe use a few bits for level, and one level could be unsorted? are they all unsorted? 
sorted + unsorted

Use url locale like
/en/whatever

The developer needs to resolve this at run time, for production is is compiled in.

using a string instead hash is irrelevant to production, seems easier to read though.
would need our own extract program.

developer is loading as an spa, the route changes as a signal. that means that localize must read as a signal or store? maybe this is an argument against the global function syntax i

    $localize` `  must return a string?

    


in general a string for a template is going to be multipart, so we need a separator character, which then means we need an escape code

or maybe we just force an id, which is probably best practice anyway?

localize`id:ddd`
no id:
localize`:ddd`

we could use typescript and compile it in? then production needs to compile it out, but that's probably pretty standard.


what if each dictionary was a store? that still doesn't get us functions.

I see the appeal of sequentially numbering the translations from a locality and bytes on the wire standpoint, but most projects have moved away from numbers (windows resource, protobuf) to fingerprints (angular, fuschia). Are sequential numbers going to be a problem for source control and rolling versions on clusters? I can't offer a specific failure point mind you but it feels like this might become an issue.

A strawman alternate would be to encourage developers to assign a specific locality id, and then use that in a sorted array. Then its very explicit. Compression fixes some of wire costs. so if we have 
<div>{_`login:Sign in`}</div>

translations becomes 

{
  "login:Sign in": "Iniciar sesi√≥n"
}

Obvious downside is now you are sending two translations when you might prefer one. I personally don't have an issue with this, but it can be eliminated if anyone thinks its a show stopper. To get back the indices I would just sort them and block them up as a static btree (hash the entire tree, which then is tied to the git commit). If people objected to the duplication between versions a "prolly tree" is a way to avoid the duplication.
