revokes could use a transparency log; key->revoketime or just key. Here we need to know that the server has recorded the revoke. we need the server to prove there is no revoke. (can merkle^2 do this?)

For the main data log we can have a hash chain, and then record the epoch hash in the transparency log. There is no lookup here, by design you read the entire log.

Is there a way though to allow the firehose readers to prove that they did not equivocate? Easy enough to compare their merkle trees.
