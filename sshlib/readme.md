This can act as a direct client or a proxy server.


SSH/SFTP proxy to webrtc based servers.
Access from anywhere (like an integrated tailscale).
Direct access, optional backup and offline data sync.



wraps normal ssh libraries and chron libraries to created scheduled operations.



how does webrtc interact with cors? how can we get a secure context?
is webrtc just a stopgap for ipv6? ipv6 ever becoming an option though? free dns?

should the ssh/sftp proxy run locally, like the Tor proxy?
how do we deploy the website that is the front end of the application?
