Blind signature based 

capability strings? structs?

schemas and databases defined by keypairs.

If each signature wraps all previous ones, then we never need to check more than one? but we need to store all the signatures we check in case they are revoked. With a 10 deep signature do we return 10 tokens then, or only one? Can we index them by their commitment?
